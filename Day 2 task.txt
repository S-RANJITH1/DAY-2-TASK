Write a blog on the Difference between Document and Window objects:

   Document Object:
      
            1.Document is the object of window property.
            2.You can access it via window.document or document.
            3.When the browser first loads code like this the browser engine reach the html code creates something called a document object model or it otherwise called dom.
            4.Dom is like trees structure that represents the html code of a page.
            5.It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM).
            6.Provides methods for browser interaction
            7.Manages properties related to frames, tabs, or windows
            8.Provides methods for interacting with the document
            Syntax:
                document.propertyname();
     
    window Object Model:
     
            1.window is the object of the browser.
            2.By default window object is available implicitly in the page
            3.The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser.
            4.The HTML document that appears in the browser window
            5.Serves as an interface for interacting with the web page's content
            6.The browser generates a Document Object Model of a web page upon loading it
            7.The window object have the majority of the properties.        
                Likes,
                    Length 
                    Inner hight
                    Name 
                    Open
                    Close,etc.,
            8.Window is the global object.
            9.However the window object is the top most object of the dom hierarchy and it represents window of frame or display the content of the web page.

            Syntax:
                window.property_name;
